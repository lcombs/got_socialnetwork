# Readme

This repository conducts an exploratory social network analysis using GOT data.

We aims to complete the following steps using the GOT dataset:

- Part 0: Data Retrieval
- Part 1: An overview of the dataset
- Part 2: Important Nodes
- Part 3: Visualizations
- Part 4: Community Detection

Code is available in the `r script `. The report is availabe as a `pdf` document. Data is retrieved from https://github.com/melaniewalsh/sample-social-network-datasets/tree/master/sample-datasets/game-of-thrones which was generated for this report:https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Mathhorizons/NetworkofThrones%20%281%29.pdf.

# Overview

Network analysis applies to a multitude of disciplines from social networks, including social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, to technological networks like airline routes. Network data can improve decision-making on investments, marketing, operations, and even biology. In addition to nodes and edges, which identify entities and the connections between them, supplemental information can also provide context to the network analysis. 

To show that these principles apply beyond the most obvious example (Facebook), this paper will explore principles of social networks in George R. R. Martinâ€™s 2000 novel, A Storm of Swords, the third from his series, A Song of Ice and Fire. The series achieved great fame via its HBO television adaptation, Game of Thrones (GOT), airing from 2011 to 2019 (imdb.com, 2020) and breaking viewership, award-nomination, and pirating records (Swatman, 2017). By using this world of famous characters, this paper aims to make the principles of social networks more accessible and entertaining to a general audience. This paper aims to conduct an exploratory analysis of a fictional social network to (1) share a data overview (2) review an analysis of important nodes known as hubs (3) build visualizations known as network layouts (4) explore possible community structures within the network.
